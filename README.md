# 🗑️ Code-garbage

## 🗒 Description

This repository is a **dumping ground for bad ideas and worse implementations**.

Here you can find:

* unfinished projects
* poorly written code
* experiments that went too far
* things that *somehow* work
* things that absolutely shouldn’t

Most projects were created:

* late at night
* out of boredom
* without proper planning
* without tests
* without shame

Each folder is its own little mistake. Some may include a README. Some may not. That’s part of the experience.

## 📂 Contents

There is **no strict structure** here.

You might encounter:

* random scripts
* abandoned apps
* proof-of-concepts
* broken refactors
* “temporary” solutions that became permanent

Browse at your own risk.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* This code is **not production-ready**
* This code is **not well-designed**
* This code is **not guaranteed to work**
* This code is **not guaranteed to keep your data, sanity, or dignity intact**

If something works — it’s accidental.
If something breaks — it’s expected.

## 🛠 Usage

You are free to:

* read it
* laugh at it
* learn from mistakes
* steal ideas (but please rewrite everything)

You are **strongly discouraged** from:

* deploying this to production
* trusting this code
* asking for support

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “It works on my machine”
> — probably past me

This repository exists so that:

* bad code doesn’t get lost
* mistakes are documented
* future me remembers *why this was a bad idea*
